## 📌 Project Overview
This project establishes the strict foundational architecture for a modern UI/API automation framework. At `v0.0.0`, the primary focus is not on testing dependencies, but on **repository governance, CI/CD pipelines, and automated script management.**

### 🎯 Goals of v0.0.0:
- Establish the Maven `pom.xml` enforcing a minimum of **Java 17 / 21**.
- Implement strict GitHub Actions pipelines (`main-ci.yml`, `feature-pr.yml`).
- Deploy a custom, milestone-gated POM Validator (`pom-validator.sh` v2.0) with HTML reporting.
- Automate repository operations (PR creation, version bumping, and issue linking) using GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## 🌿 Branching Strategy
We follow a strict Git Flow governed by GitHub Branch Protection rules:
```marmaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "Initial commit"
   branch dev
   commit id: "v0.0.0: Project Skeleton"
   branch feature/v0.1.0-setup
   commit id: "Add Playwright Core & TestNG"
   checkout dev
   merge feature/v0.1.0-setup tag: "merged feature"
   checkout main
   merge dev tag: "v0.0.0"
```
- `main` – Protected production-ready code. Commits only via Automated Release PRs.

`dev` – Protected integration branch. Commits only via passing Feature PRs.

`feature/*` – Active development branches.

## 🧮 Versioning Scheme
We strictly adhere to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) , fully automated via mvn versions:set during the release pipeline.
```marmaid
flowchart LR
    A[Commit messages] --> B{Contains<br/>BREAKING CHANGE?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Major +1]
    B -->|No| D{Contains feat:?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Minor +1, patch=0]
    D -->|No| F[Patch +1]
    C --> G[New version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[mvn versions:set]
```
**Current Baseline:** `v0.0.0` 

## ⚙️ Initial Setup
### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java JDK: `17 or 21`

- Maven: `3.8+`

- Git: `2.30+`

GitHub CLI (gh) – authenticated locally for script execution.

### 💻 Installation

# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playwright-hybrid-framework.git
cd playwright-hybrid-framework
```
# Authenticate GitHub CLI (Required for automation scripts)
```bash
gh auth login
```
# Run local POM validation
```bash
./scripts/pom-validator.sh --strict --html
```

## 🤖 Repository Automation
This framework utilizes a custom bash scripting engine to automate tedious repository management tasks:
| Script             | Purpose                                                                                     | Execution                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `pom-validator.sh` | Validates dependencies against the current milestone map. Generates Dark-Mode HTML reports. | Local & CI (`main-ci.yml`)      |
| `feature-pr.sh`    | Creates/updates Feature PRs, assigns reviewers, and links issues automatically.             | Local (Terminal)                |
| `release-pr.sh`    | Bumps SemVer, generates release notes, and auto-merges snapshot updates to `dev`.           | GitHub Actions (Manual Trigger) |
| `milestones.sh`    | Synchronizes `milestones.json` with GitHub to track project health.                         | Local (Terminal)                |
| `issues.sh`        | Batch creates GitHub issues from Markdown templates.                                        | Local (Terminal)                |

“First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.” – John Johnson

This framework adheres to this principle by prioritizing governance, CI/CD, and automation architecture before a single test is written.
